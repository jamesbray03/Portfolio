# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Projects

Welcome to the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts and implementations focused on utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for various optimization tasks. PSO is a powerful optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, making it particularly adept at solving complex optimization problems.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an optimization algorithm that mimics the collective behavior of a swarm of particles as they explore a search space to find optimal solutions. This repository showcases the application of PSO to various optimization problems, aiming to provide educational insights and practical implementations for researchers, students, and practitioners.
